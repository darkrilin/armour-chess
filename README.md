# Armour Chess
A working Chess demo made in GameMaker: Studio 1.4, with the addition of armour chess rules.

The basic idea of armour chess is that each piece has armour, and can only be captured once the armour is fully destroyed. If a capture is attempted on a piece with armour, their armour will lose durability. Similarly, the king cannot be put into check or checkmate if they still have armour.

In standard armour chess, each piece only has 1 durability of armour, but variations can be played with more armour or even differing amounts for different pieces.
